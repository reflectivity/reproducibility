# Comparing datasets

In order to ensure reproducibility in measurement, it is necessary to compare different datasets from the same materials. 
To compare, we need some statistically rigorous comparison metric. 

A potential method might be an ["overlapping coefficients"](https://doi.org/10.1080/03610928908830127) for the datapoints.
However, this would require that the datapoints are the same for both curves.
