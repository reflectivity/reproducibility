# Minimum Requirements 

Here we are trying to define the minimum requirements for a *reproducible* analysis. 
This will include at least:
- experimental data files, in a readable format (in future this will be in a ORSO defined format)
- A programmatic (columnar data file) description of the analysed scattering length density profile
